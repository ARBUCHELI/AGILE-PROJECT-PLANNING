# AGILE PROJECT PLANNING
------------------------
Properly estimating and prioritizing project requirements is critical when planning projects. 

When managing Agile projects, you need to be able to map out the work necessary for your 
product release.

In this course, you'll learn about vital Agile planning activities including creating personas and wireframing. 

This course also covers the most common Agile estimation techniques used when managing projects such as story points, wideband Delphi, and affinity estimation. 

This course also covers requirements prioritization methods and other Agile project management activities you perform when completing your release plan.

This course is one of a series in the Skillsoft learning path that covers the objectives for the PMI Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP)Â® exam. PMI-ACP is a registered mark of the 
Project Management Institute, Inc.

* Agile Project Planning
------------------------
Agile project planning involves establishing the proper project requirements, conditions of satisfaction, and priorities.

This course covers how to create and prioritize user stories. A key activity for clearly defining customer-centric requirements and features.

You'll also learn about agile estimating techniques, estimating team velocity, and prioritizing user stories and requirements.

* Defining Project Scope and Roadmap
------------------------------------
Two key planning stages in Agile are 

	. release planning and 
	. iteration planning.

At the release planning level, we define the plan for delivering a certain increment of product or business value by a target release date.

Release planning helps stakeholders start to set expectations on what they can start to see within each iteration as they approach the final release.

The key tasks of release planning include:

	. establishing project goals
	. creating user stories
	. prioritizing stories so that the team and stakeholders identify what must be developed
	. estimating stories
	. grouping stories, and 
	. setting a release date.

Iteration planning is sometimes referred to as sprint planning. It defines specific goals for the team in the next iteration.

The key tasks of iteration planning are:

	. confirming user stories and priorities for the next sprint
	. decomposing selected stories into tasks
	. refining estimates and
	. updating requirements if needed and based on new learning.

In Agile planning, we have the concept of the cone of uncertainty.

	Essentially the concept is that there is a decrease of variance overtime and estimates. So as we move forward in a project, we have last project unknowns and our estimates versus 
	actual start to approach each other, and become closer until there is no variance between them.

	Estimates may have been created using historical project data. They're used to create a high to low estimate range, and they vary depending on the type of project.

In Agile planning, we also have the concept of progressive elaboration.

	Progressive elaboration means that the project plan is continuously and constantly modified, detailed and improved.

	Progressive elaboration helps us account for changes in scope or requirements or even priorities.

	Progressive elaboration is performed throughout the project life cycle and it allows the project to be managed to a greater level of detail.

	So as the project evolves, we're actually able to manage better, because we understand more detail about the requirements, about the users and about how they're going to use our 
	product.

In the context of Agile projects, scope is defined as the extent of the work that needs to be completed in order for our project to be considered complete.

	Overtime, scope usually increases. 

	Scope is likely to change over the course of a project because requirements change and because requirements are refined as the project progresses.

	In Agile, we understand and acknowledge this fact. And we don't try to run away from the idea that scope may change as our project progresses.

	When we incorporate learning and feedback, we actually can create better products. Ultimately our goal is to create the best products for our end users and for our stakeholders.

	Scope can be controlled by continually maximizing value for the customer, such as by minimizing waste and increasing effectiveness of teams.

Scope creep is another concept in project management.

	Scope creep is uncontrolled change to a project which can result in delays or higher costs.

	Scope creep should not be confused with controlled change, which is accepted and even encouraged if it adds value for the customer.

	We must avoid scope creep by introducing change in a managed way that considers the impact to other parts of the project and is agreed to by the customer and key stakeholders.

	So what do we do if our budget and schedule are fixed, but we want to introduce a new feature or requirement? We may decide to sacrifice a less valuable feature to make room in 
	the budget and schedule for this one. This is one way to prevent scope creep.

In summary, two key planning stages in Agile are release planning and iteration planning.

* The key tasks of release planning include, 
	. establishing project goals,
	. creating user stories, 
	. prioritizing stories so that the team and stakeholders identify what must be developed, 
	. estimating stories,
	. grouping stories and setting a release date.

* The key tasks of iteration planning are, 
	. confirming user stories and priorities for the next sprint,
	. decomposing selected stories into tasks, 
	. refining estimates and
	. updating requirements if needed and based on new learning.
